#### VoiceAssistant Class (`voice_assistant.py`)
The main coordinator that:
- Manages speech recognition and text-to-speech
- Handles command pattern matching
- Coordinates between different skill modules
- Manages application state and lifecycle

#### Skill Modules (`skills/`)
Modular components for specific functionality:

### Command Processing Flow

1. **Wake Word Detection**: Listens for wake words using Picovoice Porcupine
2. **Speech Recognition**: Converts voice to text using Google Speech Recognition
3. **Pattern Matching**: Uses regex patterns to identify command intent
4. **Skill Delegation**: Routes commands to appropriate skill modules
5. **Response Generation**: Formats and delivers responses via text-to-speech

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Speech Recognition Problems
- **Issue**: "Sorry, my speech service is down"
- **Solution**: Check internet connection; Google Speech Recognition requires internet

#### Wake Word Not Detected
- **Issue**: Wake words not triggering the assistant
- **Solutions**: 
  - Check microphone permissions
  - Verify Picovoice access key
  - Adjust sensitivity settings
  - Ensure clear pronunciation

#### Spotify Integration Issues
- **Issue**: "No active Spotify devices found"
- **Solutions**:
  - Open Spotify application
  - Start playing any song to activate device
  - Check Spotify API credentials
  - Verify redirect URI configuration

#### Import Errors
- **Issue**: Module import failures
- **Solutions**:
  - Install missing packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - Check Python version (3.8+ required)
  - Verify virtual environment activation

### Debug Mode

Enable debug output by modifying the logging level in the main files:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

### Performance Optimization

#### For Faster Response Times:
- Use local speech recognition (consider Vosk for offline capability)
- Cache API responses where appropriate
- Optimize wake word sensitivity settings

#### For Better Accuracy:
- Improve microphone quality
- Reduce background noise
- Adjust speech recognition energy threshold
